    "\n",
    "The decoder though might be something new to you. The decoder needs to convert from a narrow representation to a wide, reconstructed image. For example, the representation could be a 7x7x4 max-pool layer. This is the output of the encoder, but also the input to the decoder. We want to get a 28x28x1 image out from the decoder so we need to work our way back up from the compressed representation. A schematic of the network is shown below.\n",

    "Here our final encoder layer has size 7x7x4 = 196. The original images have size 28x28 = 784, so the encoded vector is 25% the size of the original image. These are just suggested sizes for each of the layers. Feel free to change the depths and sizes, in fact, you're encouraged to add additional layers to make this representation even smaller! Remember our goal here is to find a small representation of the input data.\n",

    "### Transpose Convolutions, Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "This decoder uses **transposed convolutional** layers to increase the width and height of the input layers. They work almost exactly the same as convolutional layers, but in reverse. A stride in the input layer results in a larger stride in the transposed convolution layer. For example, if you have a 3x3 kernel, a 3x3 patch in the input layer will be reduced to one unit in a convolutional layer. Comparatively, one unit in the input layer will be expanded to a 3x3 path in a transposed convolution layer. PyTorch provides us with an easy way to create the layers, [`nn.ConvTranspose2d`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#convtranspose2d). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that transpose convolution layers can lead to artifacts in the final images, such as checkerboard patterns. This is due to overlap in the kernels which can be avoided by setting the stride and kernel size equal. In [this Distill article](http://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/) from Augustus Odena, *et al*, the authors show that these checkerboard artifacts can be avoided by resizing the layers using nearest neighbor or bilinear interpolation (upsampling) followed by a convolutional layer. \n",

    "#### TODO: Build the network shown above. \n",
    "> Build the encoder out of a series of convolutional and pooling layers. \n",
