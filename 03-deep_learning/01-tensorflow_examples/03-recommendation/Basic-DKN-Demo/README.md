DKN is a deep knowledge-aware network that takes advantage of knowledge graph representation in news recommendation.
The main components in DKN is a KCNN module and an attention module:
- The KCNN module is to learn from semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news jointly.
The multiple channels and alignment of words and entities enable KCNN to combine information from heterogeneous sources.
- The attention module is to model the different impacts of a userâ€™s diverse historical interests on current candidate news.


### Files in the folder

- `data/`
  - `kg/`
    - `Fast-TransX`: an efficient implementation of TransE and its extended models for Knowledge Graph Embedding (from https://github.com/thunlp/Fast-TransX);
    - `kg.txt`: knowledge graph file;
    - `kg_preprocess.py`: pre-process the knowledge graph and output knowledge embedding files for DKN;
    - `prepare_data_for_transx.py`: generate the required input files for Fast-TransX;
  - `news/`
    - `news_preprocess.py`: pre-process the news dataset;
    - `raw_test.txt`: raw test data file;
    - `raw_train.txt`: raw train data file;
- `src/`: implementations of DKN.

> Note: Due to the pricacy policies of Bing News and file size limits on Github, the released raw dataset and the knowledge graph in this repository is only a small sample of the original ones reported in the paper.


### Format of input files
- **raw_train.txt** and **raw_test.txt**:  
  `user_id[TAB]news_title[TAB]label[TAB]entity_info`  
  for each line, where `news_title` is a list of words `w1 w2 ... wn`, and `entity_info` is a list of pairs of entity id and entity name: `entity_id_1:entity_name;entity_id_2:entity_name...`
- **kg.txt**:  
  `head[TAB]relation[TAB]tail`  
  for each line, where `head` and `tail` are entity ids and `relation` is the relation id.


### Required packages
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):
- tensorflow-gpu == 1.4.0
- numpy == 1.14.5
- sklearn == 0.19.1
- pandas == 0.23.0
- gensim == 3.5.0


### Running the code
```
$ cd news
$ python news_preprocess.py
$ cd ../kg
$ python prepare_data_for_transx.py
$ cd Fast-TransX/transE/ (note: you can also choose other KGE methods)
$ g++ transE.cpp -o transE -pthread -O3 -march=native
$ ./transE
$ cd ../..
$ python kg_preprocess.py
$ cd ../
$ python main.py (note: use -h to check optional arguments)
```
